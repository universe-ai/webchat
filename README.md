# A browser-based web chat built using The UniverseAI Protocol

## Build and run

```sh
npm i
npm run build
serve.sh
```

Browse to `<IP:8000>/index.html`.


## Release
_Tags_ are inspired by the SemVer.org convention. The version is expected to match the following regular expression:
```
[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
```

Create a new tag from _GitHub_ so that the artifacts get automatically built by _GitHub Action_.  
To do so, draft a new release here: https://github.com/universe-ai/webchat/releases/new.
